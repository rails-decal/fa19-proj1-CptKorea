# Q0: Why are these two errors being thrown?
The contoller and models for Pokemon are not built yet. 

# Q1: How are the random Pokemon appearing? What is the common factor between all the possible Pokemon that appear? *
They are generated by the seed file. Before the random generation occurred, the starter Pokemon (Charmander, Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Pikachu) were included and they appear out in the front in the middle. Every randomized configuration will contain these four Pokemon.

# Question 2a: What does the following line do "<%= button_to "Throw a Pokeball!", capture_path(id: @pokemon), :class => "button medium", :method => :patch %>"? Be specific about what "capture_path(id: @pokemon)" is doing. If you're having trouble, look at the Help section in the README.
It creates a button that when clicked, it sends a patch request to the URI pattern capture. Then it looks at routes.rb and calles the capture function in the Pokemons controller.

# Question 3: What would you name your own Pokemon?


# Question 4: What did you pass into the redirect_to? If it is a path, what did that path need? If it is not a path, why is it okay not to have a path here?
I passed in a string interpolation with the trainers path and the id concatenated.

# Question 5: Explain how putting this line "flash[:error] = @pokemon.errors.full_messages.to_sentence" shows error messages on your form.
